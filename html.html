  <ul><ul><li><strong>Jesse James Garrett's five elements of UX design</strong>: strategy, scope, structure, skeleton and surface. These layers are by no means standalone, and influence each other. Decisions taken at one plane can cascade up or down the layers.</li><ul><li>strategy: user needs and product objectives</li><li>scope: features and content, requirements</li><li>structure: interaction design and information architecture</li><li>skeleton: information, interface and navigation design</li><li>surface: visual design</li></ul><li>We briefly saw the different <strong>design activities and deliverables</strong> involved in the design process, including personas, storyboards, customer journey maps, brainstorming, content strategy, sitemaps, user flows, wireframes, prototypes, UX writing (microcopy), mockups, design systems, usability reports and analytics.</li><li>Since experience is abstract, we explored the <strong>qualitative factors</strong> of good user experience: usefulness, usability, findability, credibility, desirability, accessibility and value.</li><li>Becoming a UX designer is not a one-time activity, but a continuous process. In order to design user experiences, a UX designer must embrace the right <strong>mindsets</strong>: practice the craft of UX design, communicate brilliantly, embrace complex and wicked problems, think flexibly, and learn to learn.</li></ul></ul>
